*Astronomers seeking to understanding the tumultuous environments home to starbirth, have developed new methods to map large swathes of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Working with the IRAM-30 metre telescope, and imaging in millimetre and submillimetre radio wavelengths, three teams have recorded and analysed a range of molecular signals concurrently, in a combined study dubbed the Orion-B project.*

GMCs are the hosts to star formation and are vast areas of gas and dust. Giving the project its name, the Orion-B molecular cloud was chosen for observation, with its array of diverse and discrete regions. Massive young stars and their high-energy ultraviolet (UV) output, dense gas, filaments of dust, protostellar jets, and a range of temperatures, all cause the molecular constituents of the cloud to emit radio-waves through a process known as ‘excitation’.

Contrasting previous methods of study, where uncertainty was introduced by analysing single molecular emission, or larger context lost by focusing on a smaller area, this project is gaining a more holistic view of GMCs. In combining both methods, the aim was to answer questions such as why some stars form with greater ease, how existing stars affect their gas/dust cocoons, and how gas/dust affects star-creation.

Observing Orion-B in a wide-spectral bandwidth using the IRAM-30 metre radio-telescope, one team mapped radio emissions of many molecules, including that of carbon monoxide (CO). Cross-checking the results with other maps, they found could identify which molecular markers best correlated to different regions, with special attention drawn to UV regions triggering CO excitation throughout most of Orion-B. Ordinarily used to infer hydrogen presence in established ratios, the results showed a need for caution, suggesting CO intensity can deviate from this correlation. Using a statistical method, a second team analysed the CO maps, finding motions of gas-compression could promote star formation in denser sites, while gas turbulence held it back it elsewhere. A colour-pixel map created by a third team, using an assortment of molecular-signals, showed the correlation between density, volume and external UV radiation at every part of the cloud.

The combined effort of these teams has provided a novel way to infer behaviour of GMCs by considering the effects of a wider environment, gaining a richer understanding. In may be wise for the project to observe additional molecular clouds, both to confirm their methods and analysis work, eliminating uncertainties, and to gain insight into other molecular and stellar processes.

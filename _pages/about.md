🪐 I am a final year university student studying toward an MPhys (Astrophysics). 

🌥️ I am an active member of a student led weather and climate club, particpating in coding workshops and helping to maintain a github account

📊 I am interested in expanding my data science skills, putting them to use in remote sensing, astronomical datasets and for tackling climate change

🧑‍🔬 I have experience writing worked physics exam solutions using LaTeX. This has helped hundreds of students develop problem solving skills in preparation for their final exam.
